# ML/DL/NLP resources recommendations

The basic ingridients to success in ML:

- Probability and Statistics 
- Calculus 
- Linear Algebra

Below are some books, mini series and full courses which I found helpful in my ML learning journey. I hope you find it as helpful as I did!

## Full Courses

### ML Courses

- Fast Ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders [course_link](http://fast.ai/)
  - top-down learning
  - pro: very practical lessons
  - con (or a pro?): bit light on the math notation requiered to parse research papers
  - great if coming from a mostly engineering background

- Stanford CS 229 - Machine Learning [resources_link](http://cs229.stanford.edu/), [videos_link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
  - bottom-up learning
  - lot of theory
  - pro: familiarizes with the math notation required for understanding papers
  - con: if not coming from a math/stats/prob. background, this may be a steep hill initially

### NLP Courses

- Fast Ai - NLP
- Stanford CS 224N - NLP with Deep Learning [resources_link](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), [videos_link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rXD5-xhemo&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z)
  - pro: covers almost all relevant topics in NLP, of which there are many in Deep Learning!
